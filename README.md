# TravelGains

This is a project I am adapting from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course, found on Udemy.

This project was created using Node.js, Express, Bootstrap and MongoDb. 

Passport.js was used to handle authentication.

## Features

- Users can create, edit and delete gyms.

- Users can review gyms, also edit or remove their reviews.

- Users can create accounts and must do so in order to add or review gymsm which is still a work in progress.

### Usage

- Currently, users will have to download the folder and in the terminal run 'node app.js' and open 'localhost:3000' in their web browser. 

- When the website is complete in 2023, it will be web hosted by Heroku and availible online.
